# Feed me fridge

A 1-Day Group project

## Overview/Reflection
This focus for this project was to allow all team members to grow their skill in an area of weakness.  With that in mind, I found this project to be a huge success. 

The user-stories for this project were:
- a user can select an ingredient in their fridge and will be shown a list of recipies based on that ingredient
- a user can select a recipe from that list and get taken to a page showing that recipe
- a user can navigate back to the homepage
